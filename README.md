The strongest correlations exist between credit amount and duration in month, as well as between credit history and the number of existing credits at this bank, which makes sense because bank accounts and number of credits generally accrue in value over time. We can also see that not a lot of the variables have very high correlations. Still, we can find some relationships have approximately r= ~ .25, and we investigated those in hopes of finding insightful patterns among different attributes which might contribute to good or bad credit evaluation.
